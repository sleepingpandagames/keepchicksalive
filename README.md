# üê£ Keep Chicks Alive!
This is the C3 Project of [my Ludum Dare 46 entry](https://sleepingpandagames.itch.io/keep-chicks-alive).
You can open the project directly in Construct 3 by opening it as a *local project folder*.

Theme was 'Keep it alive'.
Inspired by Nokia 3310 games. 
Bring back chicks to their mom before it is too late.

## ‚Ñπ About
This game uses the Nokia 3310 restrictions.
Such as its 1bit color palette, and its screen size (84 x 48 pixels - zoomed 6 times here).

This is my first Ludum Dare submission.
Built in a total of 16 hours (sprites + code).

Tools used: [Construct 3](https://construct.net), and [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org).
